\section{Introduction}

\paragraph*{}
Contour analysis can be thought of as a sub-pixel precise counterpart of \refchap{BlobAnalysis}, built upon processing of precise points organized in paths; in the same way that \refchap{BlobAnalysis} is based on processing of pixel-precise regions.

\paragraph*{}
Solutions based on contour analysis typically follow the schema of \refchap{BlobAnalysis} solutions:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Extraction} -- sub-pixel precise paths are extracted from the image, usually by means of \refchap{2DEdgeDetection}.
	\item \textbf{Processing} -- the paths are subject to transformations with an intention of rectifying the path imperfections or extracting its segments that we are particularily interested in.
	\item \textbf{Feature Extraction} -- in the final part the numerical and geometrical features may be computed.
\end{enumerate}
